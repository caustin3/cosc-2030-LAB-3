for problem 1 it overflows at 256
for problem 3 it overflows at 65536
for problem 4 it overflows at 34
for problem 5 it overflows at 171
for problem 6

Problems seven the for loop does not recognize 4.4 as equal to i = 4.4 up this is because and when incrementing through the loop the floating point number is converted into a double and then back into Float up.  When the different it is a double to begin if it registers that 4.4  is not less then 4.4
